Summary:
CRYSTALS-Kyber (a.k.a. Kyber) has been drafted to be standardized as the only
key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) scheme by the national institute of standards
and technology (NIST) to withstand attacks by large-scale quantum computers.
However, the side-channel attack (SCA) on its implementation is still needed to
be well considered for the upcoming migration. In this brief, we propose a
secure and efficient hardware implementation for Kyber by incorporating a novel
compact shuffling architecture. First of all, we modify the Fisher-Yates
shuffle to make it more hardware-friendly. We then design an optimized
shuffling architecture for the well-known open-source Kyber hardware
implementation to enhance the security of all the potential side-channel
leakage points. Finally, we implement the modified Kyber design on FPGA and
evaluate its security and performance. The security is verified by conducting
the correlation power analysis (CPA) attacks on the hardware. Meanwhile, FPGA
place-and-route results show that the proposed design reports only 8.7%
degradation on the hardware efficiency compared with the original unprotected
version, much better than existing hiding schemes.
