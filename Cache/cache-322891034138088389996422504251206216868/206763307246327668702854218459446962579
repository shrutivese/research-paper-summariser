Summary:
Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) addresses the significant challenges
of data sovereignty and AI utilization caused by the fragmentation and siloing
of data across providers and institutions. This comprehensive framework
overcomes access barriers to scalable data sources previously hindered by silos
by leveraging: 1) personal data stores as a prerequisite for data sovereignty;
2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain
for decentralized AI training, where data remains with participants and only
model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards
mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution.
This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training
on data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these
processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a
third party. It supports effective AI training, allowing participants to
maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a
decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop
beneficial algorithms.
